Challenges:
-Search functionality without copying users state
-Using formik while updating a user
-Getting id while using Route 6
-Sometimes throws an error (we believe it's because of the issues of Mock API)
-Inaccuracies after giving Star Ratings to the users' books
-Pagination took too much time to implement
